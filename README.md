This is a work in progress decompilation and recompilation project for Teen Titans on the original Xbox. Make sure you have a copy of the NTSC version.
There is a Discord server for the project: [https://discord.gg/PQ3Sc8pNN]
Methodology: Pieces of the game are slowly being re-implemented in C source code. These re-implemented pieces are then compiled and patched into the original executable, such that the re-implemented pieces are used instead of their original implementation counterparts. This approach enables incremental development, testing, and debugging.
This will be intended for PC, Linux and MacOS.
